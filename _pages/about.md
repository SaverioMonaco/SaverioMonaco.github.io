üëã Hello! I'm a PhD student from Italy working in Germany at [DESY](https://www.desy.de/). My interest lies in all things code-related, particularly in the study of _alternative Learning Models_ and _Mechanistic Interpretability_.

I am now working on _Quantum Generative models for High Energy Physics problems_.

I hold an MSc degree in Physics of Data from the University of Padua and a BSc in Physics from the University of Catania.

‚ùÑÔ∏è I use NixOS btw.
