ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm a PhD student from Italy who will soon be embarking on my doctoral journey in Hamburg, Germany at [DESY](https://www.desy.de/). My enthusiasm lies in all things code-related, particularly in exploring Learning Models and uncovering innovative frameworks for AI, ranging from Bayesian Models and Spiking Neural Networks to Quantum Machine Learning models.

I also have a profound interest in Physics, and I'm merging both passions in my upcoming PhD program, which aims to develop Quantum Generative Models for High Energy Physics experiments.

I hold an MSc degree in Physics of Data from the University of Padua and a BSc in Physics from the University of Catania.
