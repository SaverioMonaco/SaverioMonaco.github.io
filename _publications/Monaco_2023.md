**Abstract:** Quantum machine learning offers a promising advantage in extracting information about quantum
states, e.g. phase diagram. However, access to training labels is a major bottleneck for any
supervised approach, preventing getting insights about new physics. In this work, using quantum convolutional neural networks, we overcome this limit by determining the phase diagram of a model where no analytical solutions are known, by training only on marginal points of the phase diagram, where integrable models are represented.  
More specifically, we consider the Axial Next Nearest  Neighbor Ising (ANNNI) Hamiltonian, which possesses a ferro-magnetic, para-magnetic and antiphase, showing that the whole phase diagram can be reproduced.
